Python Identifiers:

A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9).

Python does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $ and % within identifiers. Python is a case sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in Python.

Here are following identifier naming convention for Python:

Class names start with an uppercase letter and all other identifiers with a lowercase letter.

Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates by convention that the identifier is meant to be private.

Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.

If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.
